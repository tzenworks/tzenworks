As this site is still in early development, case studies are on the way! So for now, some of my favourite work can be found here, all on one page, scrolly scrolly.<br/>

<h2 class="font-bold"> Veksthuset - (Identity, marketing campaign)</h2>
Student work, 2nd year at Noroff. I wanted to create an identity that works with NHM's relatively new identity designed by Bleed Studio. The task also involved marketing strategy, After Effects animation and storytelling through video.

<Image src={veksthusetMockup} alt="Mockup of a Veksthuset poster - OBLIG03, second year at Noroff" />
Mockup of a proposed marketing poster, the image on the poster was taken at Botanisk Hage, w/ Fujifilm XT-4.


<Image src={veksthusetLogo} alt="Variations of Veksthuset logo - OBLIG03, second year at Noroff" class="border-2" />
The logo, with many variations. Flexibility was the primary goal from the beginning of the design process.

<video src={vekstHusetAnim} id="video" autoplay muted loop playsinline class="border-2"></video>
Animated in After Effects.

<h2 class="font-bold">Lakrids by B체low - (Packaging)</h2>
Student work, 1st year at Noroff. The assignment involved redesigning an existing products' packaging in the style of **maximalism**. I chose the danish liquorice brand, and challenged their normally ultra-minimalistic design language. The challenge was creating maximalist compositions from many minimalistic elements. Great fun.

<Image src={lakridsBoth} alt="The two pieces of packaging, printed and assembled."/>
Two existing flavours, with a maximalist twist.

<Image src={lakridsCollage} alt="Various close-ups of the packaging."/>

<Image src={lakridsBowl} alt="The bowl hidden under the lid."/>
The packaging we were forced to work with was very interesting, a box in two parts - a bowl and a lid. Upon removing the lid, the bowl automatically unfolded itself like a flower blooming.

<h2 class="font-bold">Bl책 - (Logo & Identity)</h2>
Student work, my 3rd assignment at Noroff. Our first assignment with identity work. I was given the popular bar and music-venue Bl책, whose logo I think is too rigid, and choice of blue - too blue (it reminds me of the Windows blue-screen).
<Image src={blaaHeader} alt="logo + accompanying design elements"/>
I immediately got to work on a logo, and after weeks of iteration, ended up with the design above, and its accompanying expressive lines and circles.

<Image src={blaaMockups2} alt="Two articles of clothing." class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2" />
<Image src={blaaAnim} alt="Animated version of the logo, I would like to speed it up."/>
<h2 class="font-bold">UN - SDGs (Logo, marketing, editorial)</h2>

Student work, my first semester-assigment. It involved making a logo and marketing campaign for one of UN's Sustainable Development Goals. I chose 14: Life below water, and made a logo, two posters and a brochure filled with scary facts about how we're ruining the ocean. The logo is called "Capri-fish", by the way.

<Image src={unPoster1} alt="One of two posters featuring a fish, biting onto a straw on a fishing-line." class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2"/>
<Image src={unPoster2} alt="The second poster, mentioning how there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by 2050. Features a scale." class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2"/>
<Image src={unBrochure} alt="Spreads from the brochure." class="border-2"/>

Alright, I've now shown some of my personal favourites. That's it for now, more on the way!
