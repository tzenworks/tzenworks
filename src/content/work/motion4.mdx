A challenging motion assignment - writing, storyboarding and animating a 10-second animation in After Effects. While I am very comfortable in Ae, animating characters and scenes was a first for me.

Fitting an intro, establishing shot and a punchline into a ten second timeframe was challenging. My concept was based on a simple pun, a play on words with "firewood" and "fired wood".

The assets in the animation were all created in Illustrator, and their art direction is very plain. My plan from the beginning was to use post-processing in afterfx to give the animation more texture and character.

The post-processing does most of the work in establishing a visual style.
