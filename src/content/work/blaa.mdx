Student work, my 3rd assignment at Noroff. Our first assignment with identity work. I was given the popular bar and music-venue Blå, whose logo I think is too rigid, and choice of blue - too blue (it reminds me of the Windows blue-screen).
<Image src={blaaHeader} alt="logo + accompanying design elements"/>
I immediately got to work on a logo, and after weeks of iteration, ended up with the design above, and its accompanying expressive lines and circles.

<Image src={blaaMockups1} alt="Various mockups" class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2" />

<Image src={blaaMockups2} alt="Two articles of clothing." class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2" />
<Image src={blaaAnim} alt="Animated version of the logo, I would like to speed it up."/>
