## Blå - (Logo & Identity)
Student work, my 3rd assignment at Noroff. Our first assignment with identity work. I was given the popular bar and music-venue Blå, whose logo I think is too rigid, and choice of blue - too blue (it reminds me of the Windows blue-screen).
<Image src={blaaHeader} class="bg-hvit" alt="logo + accompanying design elements"/>
I immediately got to work on a logo, and after weeks of iteration, ended up with the design above, and its accompanying expressive lines and circles. It also turns out that it is quite difficult to make patterns featuring only happy/neutral faces.
<Image src={blaaMockups1} alt="Various mockups" class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2" />

I also made some mockups for merch items, some posters and general graphical experimentation with the assets.
<Image src={blaaMockups2} alt="Two articles of clothing." class="lg:w-[60vw] xl:w-[40vw] lg:mx-auto w-auto m-0 border-2" />
Personally quite happy with the crew shirt.
<Image src={blaaAnim} class="bg-hvit" alt="Animated version of the logo, I would like to speed it up."/>
I also thought I'd do a bit extra, and ended up animating the logo in After Effects. This version was slowed down to make it easier to break down during the project's presentation. The focus for the animation was to have fluid, human-like movement, hence the wink.
