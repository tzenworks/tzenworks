<h2 class="font-bold">Lakrids by BÃ¼low - (Packaging)</h2>
Student work, 1st year at Noroff. The assignment involved redesigning an existing products' packaging in the style of **maximalism**. I chose the danish liquorice brand, and challenged their normally ultra-minimalistic design language. The challenge was creating maximalist compositions from many minimalistic elements. Great fun.

Two existing flavours, with a maximalist twist.

The packaging we were forced to work with was very interesting, a box in two parts - a bowl and a lid. Upon removing the lid, the bowl automatically unfolded itself like a flower blooming.
