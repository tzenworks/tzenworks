Student work, 2nd year at Noroff. Veksthuset is an ambitious new musum part of Oslo's Natural History Museum, three highly modern greenhouses housing five of the Earth's climates. Our assignment was to create Veksthuset's visual identity and accompanying launch campaign.
I wanted to create an identity that works with NHM's relatively <a class="underline" href="https://bleed.com/work/naturhistorisk-museum">new visual identity designed by Bleed Studio</a>. The task involved marketing strategy, After Effects animation and video.

Mockup of a proposed marketing poster, the image on the poster was taken at Botanisk Hage, w/ Fujifilm XT-4.

The logo, with many variations. Flexibility was the primary goal from the beginning of the design process. Very much inspired by Bleed Studio's work.
