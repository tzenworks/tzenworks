An intensive photography assignment. Planning a photoshoot with a model, incorporating an element of landscape or architecture, end result being an advertisement in the form of a poster.

I took my photographs with a friend while on a vacation, on the sunny Costa Del Sol of Spain. Thus the beach became the landscape, and to make things interesting I wanted to incorporate a sense of motion and velocity in the photos.

I didn't have an idea for what the advertisement would be yet, but after I took a photo of my good friend Sanna completely missing a paddle ball - an idea quickly struck me.

Upon revisiting the poster later, I improved the legibility of the logo and made the identity of the advertiser (Notion) more obvious.
